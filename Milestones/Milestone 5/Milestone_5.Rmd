# Introduction
The paper _Policy Preferences and Policy Change: Dynamic Responsiveness in the American States, 1936-2014_ [@caughey2018policy] discusses the predictors of state policy change and pinpoints what factors have the strongest impact on a state's liberalism. In particular, the authors focus on mass political consensus and state policy response to changes in this consensus. They have acquired measures of mass policy preferences through an accumulation of multiple poll responses over time and of state policy liberalism using some defined estimates ^[These quantified liberalism estimates are estimated following a procedure defined by @caughey2016dynamics]. Responsiveness is then measured as a relationship between the liberalism of the masses and the liberalism of the policies at each given moment in time. All code can be found in my Github repository ^[All analysis for this paper is available in the Github repository at https://github.com/sardination/gov1006-final-project].

Ultimately, the authors of the paper run different types of regressions using mass liberalism (from opinion data) and policy liberalism (using measures as described in @caughey2016dynamics) as independent variables in addition to other explanatory factors such as whether a state is in the "South" or not, whether it was an election year, and a number of other features in order to determine how mass liberalism impacts policy liberalism. They find that state policies tend to respond to mass opinion in terms of liberalism, both for economic and social issues. They also find that state policies respond more strongly in the social case than in the economic one.

Interestingly, these correlations may have become more pronounced since the Carter presidency due to an increase in partisan politics shifting towards hyperpartisanism, as individual identify more strongly with a party's views on both social and economic issues and thus will reflect policy changes that align with these views [@erikson2006public]. Some scholars, like @achen2017democracy, have claimed that mass liberalism has little to no effect on policy liberalism, but the results of this paper indicate the true effect is possibly otherwise.

# Replication

The following graphic is a replication of Figure 1 from the original paper by Caughey and Warshaw [@caughey2018policy]. All code for the replication is pulled from the code provided by Caughey and Warshaw [@caughey_data] for replication and modified for the purposes of this assignment.
```{r load_data}
# Load replication resuts
load("code/output-data/Analyze.RData")
```

```{r liberalism_maps}
# Generate US maps of opinion liberalism as done in 6Figures.R. Edited for the purposes
#   of this assignment

summ.map <- merge(summ, map_data("state"), by.x="name", by.y="region")
summ.map <- arrange(summ.map, group, order)

map.yrs <- c(1940, 1975, 2010)

# Create economic liberalism US map colored by opinion data.
## Economic
summ.map %>%
  filter(Year %in% map.yrs) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group, fill=MassEcon00_mean)) +
  facet_wrap(~Year, ncol=3) +
  geom_polygon(colour="black", size=rel(.1)) +
  coord_map("polyconic") +
  viridis::scale_fill_viridis(direction=1) +
  theme_clean() +
  guides(fill=FALSE)
```
This figure is the bottom half of Figure 1 in @caughey2018policy and shows the liberalism by state in terms of opinions about economic topics (mass economic liberalism). Darker states are more conservative while lighter states are more liberal. The colors are relative among states within the same year but are not standardized from year to year.

# Appendix

Below is a replication of Table 1 in @caughey2018policy that details the linear regression analysis done on explaining policy liberalism in year $t$ given the variables of mass liberalism in the year $t-1$, whether a state is in the "South" or not, and policy liberalism in the year $t-1$.
